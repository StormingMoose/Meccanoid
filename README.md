Mecccanoid Servo Examples for Uno and Esp32


Two files are included 

Meccanoid_Servo_Degrees_Calibration.ino  

The two photos show the 0 and 180 placements to find the calibration values, enter them into the .ino file and upload to the uno.  The serial display should now be accurate.


Meccanoid_Servo_Move_Input_Degrees

Enter the same calibration data into this file and the serial monitor becomes the servo controller.
