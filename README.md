Mecccanoid Servo Examples for Uno and Esp32


Two program files are included 

Meccanoid_Servo_Degrees_Calibration.ino  

The two photos (note the wiring harness) show the 0 and 180 placements to find the calibration values, enter them into the .ino file and upload to the uno.  The serial display should now be accurate.


Meccanoid_Servo_Move_Input_Degrees

Enter the same calibration data into this file and the serial monitor becomes the servo controller.

Compile Error 

If you get the error described in the photo, use the meccanoid.zip library here, it was modified in Nov 2019.
